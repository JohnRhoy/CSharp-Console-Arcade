### Special Message 
Dear Teacher, Ma'am Amelie Tejada
  This appication was created through imaginative and creative thinking
  Please do keep in mind that not all of the Games in this application
  are entirely unique, some are coded manually, and some are referenced
  heavily from other ideas. However, I tried my best to incorporate my ideas
  into the games to make it as unique and transforming it into my very own.
  The application is run best at a terminal with a window height of 30 and
  a window width of 120. 

### To User
Dear User
  There may exist a problem within the game settings section of the partial
  class Program. If the background music are not working properly, please
  change the file path of the soundtracks within the array of SoundtrackOptions
  and replace it with the file path designated into your own laptop device storage path
  and navigate to the application folder. 

### Note from the Creator
The ascii art designs may be represented abnormally, run the application on a
terminal with a window height of 30 and a window width of 120. There are hidden 
easter eggs within the application, this includes an easter egg in the first
loading screen of the application, showing the creator's name initials in the loading bar.
You may find other easter eggs within the game, so have fun and enjoy playing!!

### Easter Eggs
 There is a one out of thirty chances of seeing the original welcome screen.
 Both the hidden welcome screen and the welcome screen has the Creator's name initials.
 In the death animation of the Hangman game, there is a one out of thirty chances of
 triggering the hidden text and a different ascii art.
 When choosing which soundtrack to play at the change background music menu of game settings,
 you may enter the keyword "j1" or "j2" to play a hidden soundtrack. Both keyword each has a 
 dedicated hidden soundtrack. Enjoy the music...
 In the Hangman game, the hidden word is chosen at random, but there is a one out of 30 chances
 of getting the Creator's name as a hidden word.
